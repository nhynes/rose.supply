ROSE Supply is a Mainnet faucet for the Sapphire ParaTime.

Check it out at [https://rose.supply](https://rose.supply).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome to any component. So far, we have:

* `app` - the very simple frontend of [https://rose.supply](https://rose.supply)
* `agent` - the trusted off-chain relayer that collects requests and sends them to the faucet contract
* `contracts` - the faucet contract(s) that hold all of the ROSE and control how it's released

Operating the service is inexpensive, but the cost is significantly non-zero. Please consider donating ROSE to `0x9997a31D8C6112F0D033E3196beA56C62D6bF105` to keep this service alive!
